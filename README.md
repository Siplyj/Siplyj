<h2>👋 Hi, I’m Viktor</h2>

I am a hobby developer from Kyiv, and I want to become a strong front-end developer.

Previously, I worked as a support specialist at Yandex, but later the company was banned in Ukraine.

In Kyiv, my wife and I started our own interior design studio called “Empty Wall.” I created the website for our studio: https://emptywall.design/

Now I want to change my career and become a professional front-end developer. I’m working hard to achieve this goal. <br/>
