<h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Viktor</h2>

Iâ€™m a beginner developer from Kyiv and I want to become a cool frontend developer. <br/>
Previously, I worked as a support at Yandex and then Yandex was banned in Ukraine :( <br/>
In Kyiv, I and my wife created our own interior design studio "Empty Wall" and I created a website for it: https://emptywall.design/ <br/>
I want to change my profession and become a front-end developer. I will try :) <br/>
